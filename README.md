# tiny-bounties

I [write](https://blog.okturtles.com) [a lot](https://fixingtao.com) [in my](https://gist.github.com/taoeffect) [spare](https://www.taoeffect.com/blog/) time and give away various knowledge/research/software.

But a lot of my thoughts never sees the light of day because I don't have the time/resources to polish them for public consumption.

This is an experiment to see if there's any interest in funding [these mini-projects](https://github.com/taoeffect/tiny-bounties/issues).

### The deal

1. :point_right: **Visit [Issues](https://github.com/taoeffect/tiny-bounties/issues) to see what's on the menu.** :point_left:
2. Read the mini-project's description, cost, and expected delivery time.
3. Click **"Post a bounty on it!"** to fund it. Mini-project's are started as soon as bounty=cost.

*Guarantee: If I don't deliver on time, I don't collect the bounty.*
