# Tiny bounties

I [write](https://blog.okturtles.com) [a lot](https://fixingtao.com) [in my](https://gist.github.com/taoeffect) [spare](https://www.taoeffect.com/blog/) time because I enjoy it. But a lot of my thoughts never see the light of day.

This is an experiment to see if there's any interest in funding what I otherwise couldn't afford to do.

# The deal

1. :point_right: **Visit [Issues](https://github.com/taoeffect/tiny-bounties/issues)** :point_left:
2. Read the mini-project's description, cost, and expected delivery time
3. Click **"Post a bounty on it!"** to fund it. Mini-project's are started as soon as bounty=cost

*Guarantee: If I don't deliver on time, I don't collect the bounty.*
