# tiny-bounties

I write a lot in my spare time and give away various knowledge/research/software:

- https://blog.okturtles.com
- https://fixingtao.com
- https://gist.github.com/taoeffect
- https://github.com/taoeffect
- https://www.taoeffect.com/blog/

But a lot of my thoughts/writings/software never sees the light of day simply because I don't have the time/resources to do a good job of polishing them for public consumption.

This is an experiment to see if there's enough interest in some of **[these idea-projects](https://github.com/taoeffect/tiny-bounties/issues)** to free them from *just-in-greg's-brain-status*.
