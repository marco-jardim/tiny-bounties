# tiny-bounties

I [write](https://blog.okturtles.com) [a lot](https://fixingtao.com) [in my](https://gist.github.com/taoeffect) [spare](https://www.taoeffect.com/blog/) time and give away various knowledge/research/software.

But a lot of my thoughts/writings/software never sees the light of day simply because I don't have the time/resources to do a good job of polishing them for public consumption.

This is an experiment to see if there's enough interest in some of **[these idea-projects](https://github.com/taoeffect/tiny-bounties/issues)** to free them from *just-in-greg's-brain-status*.

### Steps

1. :point_right: **Visit [Issues](https://github.com/taoeffect/tiny-bounties/issues) to see what's on the menu.** :point_left:
2. Click on an issue and if you like it, click the link to **"Post a bounty on it!"** using *Bountysource*.
